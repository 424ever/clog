CLOG

A simple logging library for C

I. Installation

make
sudo make install

configuration is done in the Makefile
 * C compiler is set in the `CC` variable
 * Installation directory is set with the `PREFIX` variable

II. Usage
The library provides the following log levels:

 DEBUG
 INFO
 WARN
 ERROR
 FATAL

There are constants available for these log levels with the naming CLOG_*

The clog_init() function should be called on programm start. It sets the
minimum required log level to write and the stream to which the log should be
written. The programm has to open and close the stream provided.
To write a log you can either call the clog_log() function or use the
clog_debug(),... wrappers.
